# TODO thoughts:
  - dataset methods for querying
  - decent spec coverage
  - required fields
  - defaults for fields
  - opts for storing higher precision for float / timestamps
  - optionally store timestamps as epoch or other format
  - infer default field types from their names
  - ensure sane names for methods by sanity-checking args
  - support question? attrs by stripping ? from setters
  - support for storage in JSON / plain text / arbitrary backing format
  - rack-like interface for chained encoders/decoders or maybe that's overkill
  - more efficient updates via merging with structure in-database field-by-field
  - encryption and/or interop with attr_vault
  - per-field encryption
