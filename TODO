# TODO thoughts:
  - support for storage in json / jsonb
    - run tests against all three formats in turn?
  - docs
    - dataset
    - update to note json / jsonb support
  - opt: eager_default on create for fields
  - opt: run tracking
  - more efficient updates via merging with structure in-database field-by-field
  - whole-store encryption and/or interop with attr_vault
  - per-field encryption
