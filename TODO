# TODO thoughts:
  - semantics for encoding: where is null handling?
  - drop immutable
  - like sequel, avoid modified! if no changes
  - docs
  - support for storage in JSON / plain text / arbitrary backing format
  - opt: higher precision for floats
  - opt: eager_default on create for fields
  - more efficient updates via merging with structure in-database field-by-field
  - encryption and/or interop with attr_vault
  - per-field encryption
